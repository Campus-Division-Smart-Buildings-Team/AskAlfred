Where similar issues present (such as faults with multiple fire doors or breaches of compartmentalisation), these should be l isted as one action but with all locations
identified.  Note that whilst individual issues may be low risk (e.g. simple fault with a single fire door), if accumulated (simple faults with multiple fire doors) it may be
appropriate to raise the risk level.  Equally, a low-level risk may escalate if left unattended from one review to the next.

Tolerable During discussions with the Business
school, it has been identified there
are not enough Fire Wardens trained
based in the building, this could
mean that evacuations will not be
orchestrated effectively and could
lead to risk of life.
The school will be asked to train
more fire wardens to ensure
enough wardens based in the
building.

Moderate There is only one level egress route
from the ground floor, this could lead
to issues for any users with
accessibility issues if
